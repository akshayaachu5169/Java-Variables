# Java-Variables
Java variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

1) The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
2) Variables in Java are only a name given to a memory location. All the operations done on the variable affect that memory location.
3) In Java, all variables must be declared before use.
